Aaron DavisCOSC 310Slang Translator Readme	I began this assignment trying to recursively loop through the array, which brought some unexpected difficulty. Once drawing out the problem, I decided either and Array or Arraylist would do well for this project. I opted to go with the Array, although the ArrayList would have done just as well, due to the fact the entire string or in this case array had to be looped through. The ultimate reason I choose the Array is because the Array could be given the exact size I needed and I didn’t need any dynamic data structure. 	Once thinking about the problem and implementing the Translate method, the solution was pretty straight forward. Most cases were solved with string replacement and or checking the length of the string.	The print method handled the “Yo” condition, generating a random number; either 1 or 0 and if the number is 1, printing “Yo” prior to anything else. In this method is also where I handled whether a string had more than 10 words. If the string or Array in this case had more than 10, simply ignore don’t print anymore indices from the array and only print “i” number of “yadda”
